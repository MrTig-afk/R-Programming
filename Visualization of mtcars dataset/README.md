3. Data Visualization

Plot 1: Miles per Gallon vs. Number of Cylinders

Visualize the relationship between miles per gallon (mpg) and the number of cylinders (cyl), coloring the points by engine type (vs).
Observe the trend: V-shaped engines tend to have lower mileage and more cylinders.
Plot 2: Miles per Gallon vs. Weight

Visualize the relationship between miles per gallon (mpg) and car weight (wt).
Add a smooth line to visualize the trend.
Observe a clear negative correlation: lighter cars tend to have better mileage.
Plot 3: Number of Cylinders vs. Number of Forward Gears

Visualize the distribution of cars by number of cylinders and number of forward gears using a bar plot.
Observe the relationship between these variables.
Arrange Plots:
  
  Use grid.arrange() from the gridExtra package to display the three plots side-by-side.
Key Observations:
  
  V-shaped engines generally have lower mileage and more cylinders compared to straight engines.
Car weight has a strong negative correlation with miles per gallon.
The number of cylinders and forward gears have a discernible relationship, which can be further explored.
This analysis provides a basic overview of the mtcars dataset using ggplot2 for visualization. Further analysis and more complex visualizations can be explored based on specific research questions.
