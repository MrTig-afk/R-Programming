# Exploring the mtcars Dataset with ggplot2

This README provides a summary of an R script that explores the `mtcars` dataset using the `ggplot2` package for data visualization.

---

## 1. Installation

To set up the required environment:

### Install Necessary Packages

```R
install.packages(
  c("arrow", "babynames", "curl", "duckdb", "gapminder",
    "ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes", "hexbin", "janitor", "Lahman",
    "leaflet", "maps", "nycflights13", "openxlsx", "palmerpenguins",
    "repurrrsive", "tidymodels", "writexl")
)
```

### Load the Tidyverse Package

```R
library(tidyverse)
```

---

## 2. Data Exploration

### View the Dataset

```R
View(mtcars)
```

### Get Help on the Dataset

```R
help(mtcars)
```

## 3. Data Visualization

### **Plot 1: Miles per Gallon vs. Number of Cylinders**

- **Goal:** Visualize the relationship between miles per gallon (`mpg`) and the number of cylinders (`cyl`), with points colored by engine type (`vs`).
- **Observation:** V-shaped engines tend to have lower mileage and more cylinders.

---

### **Plot 2: Miles per Gallon vs. Weight**

- **Goal:** Explore the relationship between miles per gallon (`mpg`) and car weight (`wt`) and add a smooth line to visualize the trend.
- **Observation:** There is a strong negative correlation: lighter cars tend to have better mileage.

---

### **Plot 3: Number of Cylinders vs. Number of Forward Gears**

- **Goal:** Use a bar plot to analyze the distribution of cars by the number of cylinders and forward gears.
- **Observation:** The number of cylinders and forward gears show a discernible relationship.

---

### **Arrange Plots**

- Use `grid.arrange()` from the `gridExtra` package to display the three plots side by side.

---

## Key Observations

1. **Engine Type:** V-shaped engines generally have lower mileage and more cylinders compared to straight engines.
2. **Weight and Mileage:** Car weight strongly correlates negatively with miles per gallon.
3. **Cylinders and Gears:** The relationship between the number of cylinders and forward gears warrants further exploration.

## Notes

- This README provides a concise summary of the analysis. 
- For detailed explanations, refer to the comments within the R script.
